            Stefan Salvatore is a fictional character and one of the two main protagonists from L. J. Smith's novel
            series The Vampire Diaries. He is portrayed by Paul Wesley in the television series CW's The Vampire Diaries
            and The Originals. Stefan grew up in the town of Mystic Falls, Virginia. He grew up next to his brother,
            Damon Salvatore, his father, Giuseppe Salvatore and at the start of his life grew up with his mother,
            Lillian Salvatore before she died from consumption when Stefan was just 10 years old. As Stefan grew up, he
            was known as the good child in the family, unlike his brother, Damon Salvatore, who had a knack for trouble.
            As Stefan and Damon grew up, both boys grew to not like their father because of his abusive ways. Damon
            Salvatore joined the army, and stefan was left to live with his father for a couple of months. Once Damon
            came back, the two were turned into vampires in 1864, in the town of Mystic Falls at the age of 17, by
            Katerina Petrova, who both brothers loved immensely. Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing

            Elena Gilbert is a fictional character and protagonist from the novel series The Vampire Diaries. In the
            television series adaptation, set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, she is portrayed by Nina Dobrev. In
            the books, Elena was popular, selfish and a "mean girl". However, the show's producers, Julie Plec and Kevin
            Williamson, felt that it wasn't the direction they wanted to go with their heroine in The Vampire Diaries
            television series. Instead, she became a nicer, relatable, and more of "the girl next door" type, until her
            life gets flipped upside down when she meets the Salvatore Brothers. In April 2015, Nina Dobrev announced
            that she would be departing the series after the sixth-season finale. Much of Elena's story revolves around
            her relationships with vampires Stefan Salvatore and his older brother, Damon. It is revealed that Elena is
            a Petrova Doppelgänger(like Katherine and Nadia), which is thus responsible for her being identical to her
            ancestor, Katherine Pierce (née Katerina Petrova). This also has the implication of making her a
            supernatural creature. Dobrev portrayed the "conniving" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The
            actress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys playing them both. In the
            television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a vampire and dies then deals with the struggles that come
            with her change. She took the cure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale
            of the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will only wake up when Bonnie dies in
            around 60 years. She was locked inside the Salvatore tomb, then relocated to a warehouse in Brooklyn, New
            York in the seventh season, then back to Mystic Falls. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth
            season would be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the television series to reprise
            her role in the final episode. After much speculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017,
            via an Instagram post. Dobrev appeared in the final episode of the show as both Elena and her evil
            doppelgänger Katherine Pierce. She was a real vampire and she was never a human.

            Katherine Pierce (based on Katherine von Swartzschild from the novels) is the ancestor of Elena Gilbert and
            the doppelgänger of Tatia Petrova, and Amara Petrova. Katherine Pierce was born Katarina Petrova on June 5,
            1473, to a Bulgarian family but was disowned after having a child out of wedlock. This child, Nadia, would
            eventually become a vampire who would spend 500 years searching for her mother. She fled Bulgaria and
            reached England, where she met Klaus Mikaelson and his brother Elijah, members of the Original Vampire
            Family. She was attracted to Elijah but was horrified when she found out that Klaus planned to sacrifice her
            for a ritual. So, she charmed Trevor, a young man, and used him as a means of escape. This led to him
            sending her to Rose-Marie. Rose was shocked after hearing of Trevor's betrayal and, afraid of Klaus, told
            Katerina that she would turn her over to Klaus. This led to Katerina committing suicide, ultimately stabbing
            herself, forcing Rose (a vampire) to heal her with vampire blood. When Trevor arrived, Rose went to meet him
            and Katerina, seizing the opportunity, Katerina hung herself and successfully turned into a vampire by
            killing the human host (who Rose had compelled) of the house. She then sabotaged Klaus' plan by running away
            with the moonstone. Because Katerina was no longer human, her blood no longer was a viable component of the
            ritual to undo the curse. Klaus was so infuriated with Katerina's sabotage that she was forced to live on
            the run for over 500 years as he hunted her down.

        <p class="ptvd">Bonnie Sheila Bennett (based on Bonnie McCullough from the novels) is Elena's best friend. From
            season seven,
            she
            becomes one of two female leads. She is good friends with Elena Gilbert and Caroline Forbes. In the
            beginning of
            the series, Bonnie discovers that she is a witch born from a line of witches. Her grandmother, Sheila
            Bennett,
            helps her learn to use her powers. When her grandmother dies, Bonnie continues training and becomes more and
            more powerful. In the midst of season two, she starts a relationship with Jeremy Gilbert, Elena's younger
            brother. She later discovers, from warlock Luca Martin, that the only way to kill Klaus, the original
            vampire
            who wants to kill Elena, is for her to get the power of one-hundred dead witches. Once she does this, she
            pretends to be dead in a scheme of Damon's to trick Klaus. But when she brings Klaus to the brink of death,
            Elijah does not kill him, as planned, and carries Klaus away before Bonnie could react. In the season two
            finale, Bonnie is able to save Jeremy from dying after she tells her dead ancestor Emily Bennett that she
            loves
            him. However, bringing Jeremy back from the dead allows him to see his dead ex-girlfriends. Bonnie later
            finds
            out that Jeremy kissed Anna when the doorway to the Other Side was temporarily opened, and she breaks up
            with
            him. Later on, Bonnie reconnects with her mother, Abby, who had abandoned her as a child, and who helps her
            to
            kill the original vampires. However, Abby is turned into a vampire by Damon and abandons Bonnie again. In
            the
            season three finale, Bonnie places Klaus' soul into Tyler's body, thus preventing him from being completely
            destroyed by Alaric and saving Tyler, Caroline, Damon, and Stefan from dying (as part of Klaus' bloodline).
            In
            the beginning of season four, Bonnie learns that there is a forbidden magic, but she is forced to use it to
            transfer Klaus back to his original body, as a result, angry spirits attack her grandmother's ghost.

            Lockwood. He plays for the Mystic Falls High School football team and is best friends with Matt Donovan.
            Tyler does not have a good relationship with his father, who sometimes acts violently towards him. However,
            when his father dies, Tyler is shown to be genuinely upset. In the beginning of the series Tyler is an
            arrogant bully. He is dating Vicki Donovan, who breaks-up with him for Jeremy Gilbert, causing them to
            become rivals. Tyler is shown to have a short temper and in season two Tyler learns from his uncle, Mason
            Lockwood, that he acts this way due to the werewolf gene. After Tyler accidentally kills Sarah, a classmate
            who was compelled by Katherine to provoke him, his fears come true as he has triggered the werewolf curse.
            Caroline Forbes, a young vampire, helps him prepare for his new life, and Tyler eventually falls in love
            with Caroline. A werewolf named Jules comes to town and tells Tyler that Caroline, Stefan and Damon are
            responsible for his uncle's death, making Tyler feel betrayed. After Caroline is captured by a group of

            After his mother learns that Caroline is a vampire and kidnaps her as she is trying to sneak out, Tyler
            reveals that he is a werewolf by transforming in front of her. After he helps Sheriff Forbes rescue Caroline
            from her father, they begin an official relationship. Tyler is later turned into a hybrid by Klaus. Due to
            his transformation to a hybrid, he is sired to Klaus, and would do anything to protect Klaus as his master.
            When Tyler tells Caroline that he is okay with this, she breaks up with him. Tyler eventually realizes that
            the sire bond isn't in his favor, and breaks it by repeatedly turning into a werewolf. He and Caroline get
            back together, but in the season three finale, Bonnie places Klaus' spirit in Tyler's body in order to save
            his bloodline (which includes Katherine, Stefan, Abby, Damon, Caroline and Tyler himself).

            Klaus Mikaelson is a fictional character in the series. Klaus, his father (later revealed to be his
            step-father), half-brothers, and half-sister became the very first vampires after their mother, a witch,
            cast a spell on them in order to protect them from werewolves. His mother is characterized as adulterous,
            and Klaus' biological father was a werewolf, which makes Klaus the only original vampire-werewolf hybrid in
            existence. However, his werewolf powers were bound to the moonstone by a band of witches, which includes his
            mother. To release his werewolf powers a ritual, in which a werewolf, a vampire, and a Petrova doppelgänger
            have to be sacrificed, has to take place. The first Petrova doppelgänger Klaus found was Katerina Petrova,
            but she escaped Klaus with the moonstone and hung herself in order to become a vampire so that she would be
            useless for the ritual. Klaus then wanted revenge on Katerina, causing her to spend centuries running from
            him. Hundreds of years later, Klaus finds Katerina and Elena Gilbert, the next Petrova doppelgänger, through
            Isobel Flemming. He kidnaps Katerina and makes her torture herself. After collecting the moonstone, a
            werewolf, Jules, the Petrova dopplegänger, Elena, and turning Jenna Sommers into a vampire, he begins the
            ritual, and his werewolf side is released. He later blackmails Stefan into helping him create more
            non-original werewolf-vampire hybrids, which he wants to create because he feels lonely, and turns him into
            a killer again. It is later revealed that he brought Stefan with him because they were once friends. After
            he finds out that he needs Elena's blood to create more non-original werewolf-vampire hybrids, he compels
            Stefan to stay in Mystic Falls to protect her but also turns off his humanity. He also turns Tyler Lockwood
            into his first non-original werewolf-vampire hybrid. It is later found out that Klaus killed his own mother
            because she cast the spell on him that locked away his werewolf side and that therefore his step-father,
            Mikael, has been hunting him for centuries. After Damon un-daggers Elijah, who un-daggers Klaus' other
            half-siblings, and Bonnie Bennett and her mother are able to open up the casket that holds Klaus' mother,
            Klaus is reunited with his entire family again. After saving Caroline Forbes' life by giving her his blood
            to heal her from Tyler's bite, he becomes interested in Caroline and invites her to the Original Vampires'
            ball, where they share a dance together. Bonnie later performs a desiccation spell to neutralize him, but he
            is later staked to death by Alaric. However, it is revealed that Bonnie cast a spell allowing him to inhabit
